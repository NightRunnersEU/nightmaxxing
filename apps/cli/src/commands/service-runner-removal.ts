/**
 * Removes the service runners dir (`<config dir>\service-runners`) on
 * uninstall, including when a runner in it is still running.
 *
 * Windows never deletes the image of a running process, so an uninstall run
 * by the runner exe itself (or while a scheduled sync is still running) could
 * delete everything but that exe. Windows does let a running image be renamed,
 * and with it the dir it sits in, which is how npm moves a running package
 * aside. So on Windows a runners dir that will not go away is renamed to a
 * retired name next to it: the service is fully uninstalled at once, and a
 * later install writes a fresh runners dir. A hidden wscript.exe waits for the
 * exe to exit and deletes the retired dir, and every later install, uninstall
 * and scheduled run sweeps any retired dir that is still there.
 *
 * Both the delete and the rename can also fail for a moment while antivirus,
 * the indexer or a child that just exited still holds a handle in the dir, so
 * they are retried for about 2 s (windows-fs-retry.ts). A dir that still will
 * not go (a handle held for longer, without the share-delete flag) gets the
 * same hidden cleanup, deleting it where it is: the uninstall still leaves
 * nothing behind once the handle goes. That cleanup is pending under a
 * `service-runners.pending-<id>` marker, and an install that would write into
 * the dir first claims it (deletes the marker and waits for the script to see
 * that), so the cleanup never deletes a reinstalled runner.
