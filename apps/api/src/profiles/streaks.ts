/**
 * Streaks over opaque YYYY-MM-DD usage keys, using string day arithmetic (no
 * `Date` parsing; zero-padded keys sort and compare lexicographically).
 * Malformed keys and keys beyond the ingest ceiling are ignored rather than
 * trusted, so legacy bad rows cannot fail a profile.
 *
 * `currentStreakDays` is the run ending on the latest active day, but only
 * while that run is still alive: its last day must be no earlier than
 * "yesterday" for the user. Keys are local-time buckets and the server does
 * not know the user's timezone, so "yesterday" is measured from the earliest
 * local date anywhere (UTC today - 1, i.e. UTC-12), making it UTC today - 2.
 * A lapsed run reports 0 — the field name promises a current streak.
