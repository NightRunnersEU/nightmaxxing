# Changelog

All notable changes to nightmaxxing are documented here. Versions are anchored to the
`cli-v*` release tags because the CLI is the project's current released artifact.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Profiles show an Agents breakdown (all-time spend, tokens and active days per coding agent) and
  a Token mix with the cache hit rate.
- Monthly recaps at `/<login>/recap/<YYYY-MM>`: the month's spend, tokens, rank, top model and
  agent, peak day, streak and cache hit rate, with a shareable card. Profiles link to the current
  month's recap.
- The leaderboard ranks "This month" and can be limited to one agent.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-10-05

Brings Nightmaxxing up to date with upstream tokenmaxxing 0.7.6. The upstream 0.7.0–0.7.6
entries below describe each change in detail.

### Added

- New sources: Oh My Pi, Grok Build CLI, Antigravity, ZCode, Amp, Qwen Code, Kimi CLI, Kilo Code,
  Goose, Droid, Codebuff and OpenClaw.
- `NIGHTMAXXING_NPM_REGISTRY` (npm mirror for version checks and runner downloads) and
  `NIGHTMAXXING_SYNC_WINDOW_DAYS` (how many past days scheduled syncs re-send).
- Profiles show a Monthly Tokens chart next to Monthly Spend.

### Changed

- Scheduled syncs skip agents whose logs have not changed, and capture custom agent log
  directories (OpenCode, Gemini, Copilot, Pi, XDG) when the service is installed or repaired.
- `upgrade` installs an exact version and verifies it; `service doctor` exits 1 on a problem.

### Fixed

- Many service fixes from upstream 0.7.x across macOS, Linux and Windows, including Node from
  fnm/asdf/mise/nodenv on the service `PATH`, falling back to npx when bun cannot run ccusage, and
  clearer reasons when a scheduled sync fails.
- Local filesystem paths are stripped from model names before they are stored.

## 0.7.6 - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Scheduled syncs work again for Node installed through asdf or mise when no global Node version
  is set (only a project's `.tool-versions`, `mise.toml` or `.node-version`). Since 0.7.0 the
  service wrapper's `PATH` swapped a version's install directory for the manager's shims, which
  pick a version from the job's working directory (`/` under launchd, `~` under systemd) and found
  none: one macOS device failed every run since its 0.7.0 migration with
  `ccusage command failed: nodejs 26.3.0`. asdf, mise and nodenv entries on the wrapper's `PATH`
  now lead to the newest installed Node's own `bin` directory, ahead of the shims, the same from
  any shell (with or without `asdf exec`/`nodenv exec`, mise activate or shims mode). The service
  template moves to 9, so each service's next run repairs its wrapper once; a wrapper whose `PATH`
  is unchanged is not rewritten. Volta, nvm and fnm are unchanged.
- A failed ccusage run's reason is now the stderr line that says why rather than the last one:
  dyld's `Library not loaded: …` instead of the tail of its `Reason: tried: …`, asdf's
  `No preset version installed for command node` or mise's `No version is set for shim: node`
  instead of the installed versions listed after it, and npm's error instead of where it wrote its
  log. The source's stored stderr keeps that line even when it came before the last five, and long
  lines are cut at the end rather than the start.

## 0.7.5 - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Syncs no longer fail on every run when `bun` is on `PATH` but takes the `x` of `bun x` for a
  script name: it prints `error: Script not found "x"` (or `missing script "x"` before Bun 1.0.19)
  and ccusage never runs. One Linux device's every run failed with
  `codex: ccusage command failed: error: Script not found "x"`, and npx was never tried because
  bun had been found and started. ccusage now falls back to npx then too. When there is no npx
  either, the reason says so, e.g. `bun does not support \`bun x\` (error: Script not found "x")
  and npx is not on PATH; update Bun or install Node.js`. A ccusage that ran and failed is still
  reported as such.

## 0.7.4 - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Windows: `service uninstall` no longer leaves the service runners dir (about 78 MB) behind when
  Windows will not let it be renamed aside either, say because antivirus keeps the running runner
  open for longer than the uninstall's retries. The same hidden cleanup that deletes a renamed-aside
  dir now deletes `service-runners` where it is, once whatever holds it lets go. Before, it was
  left for the next install or uninstall, which after an uninstall might never come. A
  `service install` while that cleanup is still pending cancels it first, so it never deletes the
  new runner.
- Windows with Bun installed through npm (`npm i -g bun`, or another tool that puts a `bun.cmd`
  shim on `PATH` instead of `bun.exe`): syncs work again. Since 0.7.0, every agent failed with
  "ccusage command failed" and no further detail: Bun 1.4, which the CLI is built with, refuses
  to start the shim with the `^` in ccusage's version range, and npx was never tried because bun
  had been found. The CLI now runs `bun.exe` by its path wherever it is on `PATH`, and a
  `bun.cmd`/`bun.bat` shim through `cmd.exe` the way it runs `npx.cmd`.
- When bun is there but cannot be started at all, ccusage falls back to npx, as it already did
  when bun was missing. A ccusage that ran and failed is still reported as such.
- When ccusage fails without printing an error, the reason now says which runner ran it and how it
  ended, e.g. `bun.cmd could not be started (EINVAL)` or `npx.cmd exited with code 1`, in
  `sync`, `service status`, the service log and the device's reported error.

## 0.7.3 - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Added Oh My Pi (OMP) as a supported source (`--sources omp`). It runs ccusage's Pi parser on
  OMP's own sessions: `~/.omp/agent/sessions` plus every named profile, following `PI_CONFIG_DIR`
  and `$XDG_DATA_HOME/omp` like OMP. OMP ignores `PI_AGENT_DIR` and a ccusage.json `piPath`, and
  Pi skips any `PI_AGENT_DIR` entry that points at OMP's sessions, so neither counts the other's
  sessions and the `PI_AGENT_DIR=~/.omp/agent/sessions` workaround can stay set. Thanks
  @theoparis (#67).
- Scheduled syncs now keep `PI_CONFIG_DIR` and `XDG_DATA_HOME`, so they find OMP's (and
  OpenCode's) data where a foreground sync does.

### Fixed

- A scheduled sync in which every agent failed now reports why each one failed (the reason and the
  last line of ccusage's error output, grouped by reason as on the console) in `service status`,
  the service log and the device's reported error, instead of only "ccusage source collection
  failed". Home directories in that output are replaced with `<home>`. `service doctor` shows the
  summary line.
- When neither bun nor npx can be found, the error names the agents and, on Windows, the `npx.cmd`
  shim it looked for.
- Windows with Node from fnm: a service repair that finds the shell's fnm link gone (fnm links
  each shell's Node through `%LOCALAPPDATA%\fnm_multishells`) keeps Node on the service's `PATH`
  through fnm's default alias in `%APPDATA%\fnm`. It used to drop it, and every scheduled sync then
  failed to run ccusage. This hits services moving off a 0.6.0 install, whose `PATH` named the
  link of the shell they were installed from.
- Model names that are local file paths (llama.cpp, LM Studio, MLX and other local runners report
  the file they loaded, e.g. `/home/<you>/models/gemma.gguf`) are reduced to the file or directory
  name before upload, so your home directory no longer leaves the device. A Hugging Face cache
  path keeps its file name, or `<org>/<repo>` when it names only the snapshot. Provider ids with
  slashes (`openai/gpt-5`, `~anthropic/…`) are unchanged.
- Scheduled syncs now keep the custom data directories of OpenCode (`OPENCODE_DATA_DIR`), Gemini
  CLI (`GEMINI_DATA_DIR`), GitHub Copilot CLI (`COPILOT_HOME`, `COPILOT_OTEL_FILE_EXPORTER_PATH`)
  and Pi (`PI_AGENT_DIR`), and Claude Code's projects under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/claude` when
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is unset. The service didn't capture these variables, so a foreground `sync`
  honoured them while scheduled runs read the default locations. `service doctor` now warns when
  they drift; run `nightmaxxing service repair` once if you set any of them.
- Windows: `service uninstall` run from the service runner exe failed now and then with "failed to
  uninstall nightmaxxing service" after the scheduled task was already gone, and left the runner
  behind. Windows refuses to delete or rename a dir for a moment while antivirus, the indexer or a
  process that just exited still has a file in it open. Service file deletes and renames now retry
  for about 2 s. A runners dir that still cannot be removed no longer fails the uninstall: it is
  listed in `pendingRemoval` with a warning, and the next `service install` or `service uninstall`
  removes it.

### Server

- The API accepts `omp` on `/usage/ingest` and `/usage/sync` and stores its models without the
  `[pi]` label ccusage's Pi parser adds. The site labels it "Oh My Pi" on the stats page, home
  page, FAQ, privacy policy, and llms.txt.
- The API also reduces model names that are local file paths to their file name at ingest, from both stored usage rows and stored raw reports, so
  uploads from older CLIs never store or show them on profiles, stats or the leaderboard. Paths
  that reduce to the same name on the same day are merged.
- Chart tooltips on the site stay inside the chart and the screen on phones (they were clipped
  and could scroll the page sideways), and a tap now keeps a tooltip open until you tap elsewhere
  or scroll.

## 0.7.2 - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Windows without Bun: syncs failed with "unexpected CLI failure" in 0.7.0 and 0.7.1, and scheduled
  runs ended right after reporting that they had started, with nothing uploaded, logged or
  reported. Without `bun`, ccusage runs through npm's `npx.cmd`, and the Bun release those
  versions were built with refuses to start a `.cmd` file without a shell. `npx.cmd` now runs
  through `cmd.exe`. An affected service picks this up through its next auto-update and resumes
  syncing, and moves off the old task (and its console window) on the run after.
- An agent whose ccusage command cannot be started now fails on its own, with the reason, and the
  other agents still sync. Any other unexpected error in a scheduled run is logged, reported and
  repaired like a failed sync. Before, both ended the run right after its started check-in with
  nothing recorded.

## 0.7.1 - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Linux: the deferred service repair (after an update, or when the timer is inactive) runs when the
  config dir contains a quote, backslash or `$`. systemd re-reads its pending unit on any
  `daemon-reload` and could not load that path, so the repair never ran and stayed "scheduled".
  It also starts about 2 seconds after the scheduled run instead of up to a minute later.
- `service install` and `service repair` refuse a config dir that contains a tab, newline or other
  control character, with an error that says so. Before, a Linux install there failed with a
  generic error, and moving an existing install to such a dir reported success but left a unit
  that never ran.
- Windows: a sync that starts while another is still running (the service's wrapper run by hand,
  or a run left going after the task was ended) no longer exits 0 without running or logging
  anything. `cmd` holds `service.log` for a whole run, so the second run couldn't open it; it now
  logs to `service-overlap-1.log` (up to `-4`) instead, and a log held by another process is no
  longer half-rotated. Task Scheduler itself never overlaps runs. The service rewrites its
  wrapper once on its next run.
- A scheduled run that finds another run holding the lock logs a `"status":"skipped"`,
  `"reason":"locked"` line instead of printing nothing.
- On Windows, `nightmaxxing service uninstall` run by the service runner exe itself (the
  `nightmaxxing.exe` under `service-runners\`) failed with "Failed removing service files",
  because Windows cannot delete a running exe. It now removes the task and every other service
  file, moves the running runner aside, and a hidden cleanup deletes it once it exits.
  `service status` and `service doctor` then report the service as not installed.
- `nightmaxxing service install` or `service repair` run by the service runner exe keeps that
  runner instead of downloading it again. Without the npm registry it failed with "missing
  service runner package".

## 0.7.0 - 2026-09-29

### Upgrading

- From 0.6.0: the background service updates itself to 0.7.0 and migrates its files on the next
  run; nothing to do. On macOS this can show the “nightmaxxing.sh can run in the background”
  notice one last time. Later updates leave the service files alone.
- `nightmaxxing login` now uses a device-code flow. Existing logins keep working, and older CLIs
  keep the previous flow until 2027-11-01.
- From 0.7.0-alpha.2 or earlier:
  - On Windows, reinstall an `npm install -g --prefix <dir>` install once by hand
    (`npm install -g --prefix <dir> @nightrunners/nightmaxxing@latest`); those versions' `upgrade`
    installs into npm's default prefix instead.
  - Upgrade the global CLI before running `nightmaxxing service repair`. A repair from an older
    global CLI can briefly move the service back to that version; it updates itself again on the
    next run.

### Added

- New sources: Grok Build CLI, Antigravity, ZCode, Amp, Qwen Code, Kimi CLI, Kilo Code, Goose,
  Droid, Codebuff and OpenClaw (`--sources grok,antigravity,zcode,amp,qwen,kimi,kilo,goose,`
  `droid,codebuff,openclaw`), each read through its focused ccusage subcommand. Scheduled syncs
  keep their custom data directories (`GROK_HOME`, `ANTIGRAVITY_DATA_DIR`, `ZCODE_HOME`,
  `AMP_DATA_DIR`, `QWEN_DATA_DIR`, `KIMI_DATA_DIR`, `KILO_DATA_DIR`, `GOOSE_PATH_ROOT`,
  `DROID_SESSIONS_DIR`, `CODEBUFF_DATA_DIR`, `OPENCLAW_DIR`).
- `NIGHTMAXXING_NPM_REGISTRY` points version checks and service-runner downloads at another npm
  registry (a mirror). A service install captures it for scheduled syncs.
- `NIGHTMAXXING_SYNC_WINDOW_DAYS` (1–90) overrides how many past days scheduled syncs re-send.

### Changed

- Requires ccusage 20.0.22 or newer, which counts `claude-fable-5-1` usage again and has every
  supported adapter.
- Scheduled syncs re-send the last 21 days every 6 hours (and on the first run after upgrading),
  so days that ccusage later re-counts are corrected on the leaderboard. This also recovers
  September usage that ccusage 20.0.20 undercounted.
- Scheduled syncs skip sources whose logs haven't changed and only rebuild session counts on the
  6-hourly reconcile, cutting background CPU for large Codex logs. `service run --force` runs every
  source. Thanks @NubsCarson for the report (#69).
- `nightmaxxing upgrade` installs the exact version the registry reports (for example
  `npm install -g @nightrunners/nightmaxxing@0.7.0 --prefer-online`), never a dist-tag, and checks
  `nightmaxxing --version` afterwards. It never downgrades: prerelease installs follow their
  channel (e.g. `alpha`) and move to `latest` only when it is newer. When the registry can't be
  reached it stops instead of guessing. Failures show the command and the package manager's own
  output, in `--json` too (`command`, `output`, `expectedVersion`, `installedVersion`), and
  `upgrade --json` adds `channel`/`channelVersion`.
- `nightmaxxing service doctor` exits 1 when any check is `WARN` or `FAIL` and 0 when all are `OK`
  or `INFO`. A new `FAIL` level marks what stops scheduled syncs, and `--json` adds `health` and a
  `fix` per problem. Every line now says what's good, or what's wrong and the one command that
  fixes it, and `service status` uses the same wording.
- `service repair` and `service install --refresh` refuse to move a service backwards (a newer
  runner or template than the CLI's); status and doctor say to upgrade the CLI instead.
- `nightmaxxing` exits with 128 + the signal number when a signal stops it (143 for `SIGTERM`),
  and handles `SIGHUP` too.

### Fixed

- The background service:
  - On macOS, updates no longer show the “nightmaxxing.sh can run in the background” notice again. Refreshes
    and repairs leave unchanged files alone and only reload launchd or systemd when the definition
    changed, and the script keeps the same `PATH` from any terminal (per-shell fnm directories
    resolve to fnm's default alias; temporary, agent-session and app-bundle directories are left
    out).
  - On Windows, the scheduled sync no longer opens a console window or steals focus: it runs
    through a hidden `wscript` launcher, and config paths with spaces, `&`, `'`, parentheses,
    `%` or non-ASCII characters work. Refreshes and repairs no longer re-register an unchanged
    task (which restarted its schedule), including from a shell whose config dir path differs only
    in case. Thanks @sybrengg (#38) and @tanqyry (#72); fixes #57.
  - On Linux, a config directory containing `%`, a quote or a backslash no longer gives a unit
    systemd refuses to load. Run `nightmaxxing service repair` to rewrite an affected unit.
  - A hanging ccusage no longer blocks automatic sync. ccusage runs in its own process group and a
    timeout stops the whole group; after one timeout a run skips the remaining sources, and no
    source starts more than 10 minutes into a run. The systemd unit gets `TimeoutStartSec=30min`
    as a backstop.
  - A run killed by `SIGKILL`, the OOM killer or a power loss no longer blocks syncing for 2 hours:
    the next run takes over a lock whose process is gone.
  - A scheduled run where every agent's ccusage failed exits non-zero, and the log includes the end
    of ccusage's stderr (for example `env: node: No such file or directory`).
  - A failed login check (`/me`) is retried on network errors, timeouts, 5xx and 429, and says
    what happened (`network unavailable (ENOTFOUND)`, the HTTP status, a timeout); the service log
    gets a `loginCheck` field. Transient API failures no longer schedule a repair.
  - `service repair` no longer installs a service where none exists, or re-points a scheduler that
    another config dir installed; `upgrade` no longer refreshes another config dir's service.
  - On Windows, `service install` and `service repair` refuse to run elevated when UAC gives the
    user a limited token day to day, since a task registered that way can't be changed later.
  - Scheduled syncs carry custom `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME` and `HERMES_HOME` roots like a
    manual `sync`; `service doctor` warns when the service's roots differ from your shell. Thanks
    @maxmoneycash (#71).
  - `service doctor` and `service status` report a broken runner (missing, empty, non-executable,
    or a bad pointer), a missing `service.json`, and whether a held lock's process still runs.
- `nightmaxxing upgrade`:
  - Works for npm global installs on Windows (the shim in the npm prefix wasn't detected), and for
    `npm install -g --prefix <dir>` installs, which it now updates in place.
  - On Windows it no longer leaves a ~78 MB copy of the previous version in
    `node_modules\@nightrunners\.nightmaxxing-<hash>`; the next upgrade or scheduled run removes it.
- `bun add -g --trust` and `yarn global add` installs work on Windows: the package `bin` is a
  small launcher that runs the verified native binary. Thanks @Iydah (#28). On macOS and Linux, a
  Ctrl+C or `kill` that arrives while the launcher is starting now reaches the native binary.
- Hermes usage includes named profiles (`~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/state.db`). Thanks @kvnloo (#68).
- `sync`, `login` and `whoami` time out instead of hanging on an API that never answers (60 s for
  uploads, 15 s for login checks and login requests), wait out rate limits ("try again in 60 s"),
  and report server errors as server errors instead of "check your network".
- `sync` says when neither bun nor npx is installed, and names the reason ccusage failed per
  agent. It exits non-zero when every source fails and rejects `--since` values that aren't a real
  `YYYY-MM-DD` date.
- A `config.json` that is valid JSON but not a config fails with "CLI config is not valid" and its
  path. A stored token is only cleared when the server says it is invalid, not on transient errors.
- Login and sync errors show the server's message (for example an expired login code).

### Server

- The API accepts the new sources, and the site labels them on the stats page, home page, FAQ,
  privacy policy and llms.txt.
- Usage uploads are validated more strictly (dates, token counts, sources, sizes); future-dated
  days are dropped, and bad rows from older CLIs no longer reject a whole sync.
- Re-syncing unchanged usage no longer re-prices history: stored cost is kept unless token counts
  change.
- API errors return a consistent JSON body with a `_tag` and `message`. The unauthenticated CLI
  login endpoints are rate-limited per network (HTTP 429 with `Retry-After`).
- The production API only trusts `https://maxxing.nrght.eu` for CORS and sign-out.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-08-05

- Carried custom `HERMES_HOME` locations into scheduled syncs.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Required ccusage 20.0.19 or newer to prevent replayed Codex subagent history from inflating usage totals.
- Treat successful raw daily reports as authoritative device/day/source slices so corrected
  backfills remove stale model rows, and run one full Codex replay after service upgrades.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Added Pi as a supported ccusage source.

### Changed

- Changed sync to upload daily reports plus source-level session counts instead of raw session payloads.
- Normalized source-prefixed model labels while preserving raw model names in usage charts.
- Removed the unsupported Cursor source.

### Fixed

- Fixed ccusage launching on Windows by using Bun's executable runner and the Windows npm launcher fallback.

## 0.4.23 - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added GPT-5.6 tier tracking by using a ccusage release with GPT-5.6 pricing support.
- Added aggregate public stats for tracked spend, tokens, models, sources, users, and devices.
- Added internal shadow-ban moderation controls to remove selected accounts from public surfaces.

## 0.4.22 - 2026-06-27

- Fixed Windows native CLI startup by removing the module guard and accepting standalone executable argv shape.

## 0.4.21 - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows native CLI executables exiting without output by using Bun's native entrypoint signal.

## 0.4.20 - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows npm installs so generated command shims launch the native CLI executable instead of asking Node to parse it.

## 0.4.19 - 2026-06-23

### Changed

- Made generated npm installs run native postinstall through Bun when available, with Node as a fallback.
- Updated Bun install guidance to use `bun add -g --trust @nightrunners/nightmaxxing`.

### Fixed

- Made the npm-installed CLI fall back to the installed native optional package when lifecycle scripts are blocked.
- Improved failed native install diagnostics for script-blocked and shadowed global installs.

## 0.4.18 - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Added native npm CLI packages for supported platforms while keeping scheduled sync pinned to a config-owned runner snapshot.

### Changed

- Changed scheduled sync auto-update to use verified registry runner packages instead of ambient Node/npm/vite-plus paths.
- Bumped the service template so installed schedulers repair onto the native runner wrapper and template metadata.
- Made internal admin outdated labels compare prerelease clients against their matching npm release channel.

### Fixed

- Fixed service repair for native npm installs so it copies nested platform package runners correctly.
- Prevented prerelease runner auto-updates from downgrading or crossing release channels.

## 0.4.18-alpha.6 - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Bumped the service template version to force installed schedulers through the repair/reload path for alpha validation.

## 0.4.18-alpha.5 - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

## 0.4.18-alpha.4 - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Changed npm installs to materialize a native `nightmaxxing` binary from generated `@nightrunners/nightmaxxing-<target>` packages.
- Renamed generated native packages away from the alpha-only `@nightrunners/nightmaxxing-service-<target>` package family.

## 0.4.18-alpha.3 - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Reissued the service-runner alpha to validate channel-aware runner updates end to end before the stable release.

## 0.4.18-alpha.2 - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Made registry-based service runner auto-updates follow the installed runner's release channel and reject downgrades or cross-channel candidates.
- Made service install and repair registry fallback fetch the exact runner version for the current CLI build.

## 0.4.18-alpha.1 - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Reissued the alpha service-runner release through GitHub Actions trusted publishing after bootstrapping the generated runner packages.

## 0.4.18-alpha.0 - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Added native, config-owned service runners for scheduled syncs so launchd, systemd, and Windows Task Scheduler no longer depend on ambient Node, npm, Bun, or vite-plus paths.
- Added generated platform runner package publishing with npm prerelease dist-tags.

### Changed

- Changed scheduled service auto-update to fetch verified runner packages from the npm registry and atomically advance the service runner pointer.

### Fixed

- Hardened service install, repair, and runner update locking so concurrent repairs and updates cannot overlap.
- Prevented deferred launchd repairs from reloading the active launchd job from inside itself.

## 0.4.17 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Made scheduled Linux service repairs use `systemd-run --user` so reload-required repairs survive systemd oneshot cleanup.

## 0.4.16 - 2026-06-21

### Changed

- Removed the service auto-update opt-out so scheduled services always attempt CLI updates when package-manager metadata is available.
- Bumped the service template so installed schedulers refresh away from legacy auto-update metadata.

### Fixed

- Made service install and repair keep working when the package manager cannot be detected, while reporting the missing manager through auto-update telemetry.

## 0.4.15 - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added structured auto-update telemetry for scheduled service check-ins so fleet status can show update-blocked devices with concrete reasons.

### Changed

- Made scheduled service auto-update verify the installed CLI version after package-manager updates before reporting success.

## 0.4.14 - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added automatic service repair telemetry for scheduled sync check-ins and internal fleet details.

### Changed

- Made scheduled service runs retry deferred scheduler repair when the scheduler is inactive, the service template is stale, auto-update changes the CLI, or the service run fails.

### Fixed

- Fixed inline command snippets so CLI flags render with visible spacing instead of font ligatures.

## 0.4.13 - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added `nightmaxxing service repair` to refresh service files and re-register native schedulers.
- Added automatic sync service check-ins for scheduler health and repair-needed fleet status.
- Added a homepage bootstrap hero with a copyable install-and-bootstrap command.
- Added `/terms` and `/privacy` pages.
- Added avatars to the internal admin fleet page.

### Changed

- Changed automatic sync to run every 5 minutes.
- Deferred native scheduler repair after scheduled auto-updates so the active job is not reloaded by itself.
- Made service install prefer durable command paths for transient FNM multishell shims.
- Refactored web route data loading to TanStack Query suspense with SSR preloading.
- Made the API client forward auth cookies during SSR.
- Simplified the custom web server setup and removed unused route exports/tests.
- Switched route search parameter parsing to Zod.
